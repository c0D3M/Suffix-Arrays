# Suffix Arrays
I am sharing my experince with various Suffix Array Construction Algorithms(SACA).

# Introduction
Few years back I stumbled upon this nice data structure Suffix Tree. I must admit its construction is a bit complex.
While studying more about it, I read about Suffix Array.
There are so many algorithm being developed considering vast application of Suffix Array in patter matching, compression, Genome Sequencing.
