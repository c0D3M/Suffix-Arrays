# Suffix Arrays
I am sharing my experince with various Suffix Array Construction Algorithms(SACA).

# Introduction
Few years back I stumbled upon this nice data structure Suffix Tree. I must admit its construction is a bit complex.
While studying more about it, I read about Suffix Array.
There are so many algorithm being developed considering vast application of Suffix Array in patter matching, compression, Genome Sequencing.These Algorithm can be categorised into broadly three category.
Complete taxonomy of these algorithm can be found [here](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~bill/best/algorithms/07Taxonomy.pdf)
* Prefix Doubling 
* Recursive Algorithm
* Induced Sorting
